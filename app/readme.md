Let's review the folder structure:




•  The app folder is where you keep your Express application logic and is divided into the following folders  
   that represent a separation of functionality to comply with the MVC pattern:
°  The controllers folder is where you keep your Express application controllers
°  The models folder is where you keep your Express application models
°  The routes folder is where you keep your Express application routing middleware
°  The views folder is where you keep your Express application views



The config folder is where you keep your Express application con guration  les. In time you'll add more modules to your application and each module will be con gured in a dedicated JavaScript  le, which is placed inside this folder.  urrently, it contains several  les and folders, which are as follows 


° The env folder is where you'll keep your Express application environment configuration files
° The config.js file is where you'll configure your Express application
° The express.js file is where you'll initialize your Express application
